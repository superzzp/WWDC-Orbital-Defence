# WWDC-Orbital-Defence
As a member of Apple Space Task Force, protect the Spacewide Developers Conference 2119 from alien invasion.

Used ARKit, SceneKit, UIKit, SpriteKit and Linear Algebra. Developed with Swift and Playground, which is a IDE similar to XCode, but allows you to run code directly on Ipad.
