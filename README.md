# WWDC-Orbital-Defence
As a member of Apple Space Task Force, protect the Spacewide Developers Conference 2119 from alien invasion.

Used ARKit, SceneKit, UIKit, SpriteKit and Linear Algebra. Developed with Swift and Playground, which is an IDE similar to XCode, but allowing to run code directly on iPad.
