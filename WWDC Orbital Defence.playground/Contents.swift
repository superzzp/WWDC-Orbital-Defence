// The moment finally comes. You drove your spaceship all the way from the other side of the galaxy, and just jumped out of the star gate and entered the solar system. Spacewide Developers Conference 2119 is about to happen and you are one of the lucky attendees.

// You are soo excited, and turn your spaceship to full throttle. Suddenly, you see something strange: The earth is under attack from invading UFOs!!!

// Aliens are trying to capture space's coolest developers that are attending SWDC!

// However, the aliens haven't realize ... you are a secret member of Apple Space Task Force!

// Shoot down alien's UFOs and hold until Apple's Star Fleet comes!

// Tap on ground to create a stargate in AR. Start the game by walking into the stargate.
